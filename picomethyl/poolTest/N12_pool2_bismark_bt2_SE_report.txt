Bismark report for: N12_pool2.fastq (version: v0.17.1_dev)
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /work/02260/grovesd/lonestar/bismark_Amil_Zach_Fullers_v2.00/ with the specified options: -q -N 1 --score-min L,0,-0.6 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
