#Steps for running statistical analyses on outputs from the data processing steps


Get stats on pipeline counts
	figure_plotting/pipeline_counts.R


Prepare data from each assay:

	#WGBS
	complete steps in picoMethyl_data_processing_pipeline.txt
	format methylation level and responses with picomethyl/process_picoMethyl.R

	#MBD-SEQ
	complete steps in mbdseq_data_processsing.txt
	estimate methylation level and responses with mbdSeq/process_MBDseq.R

	#MethylRAD
	complete steps in methylRAD_data_processing_pipeline.txt
	estimate methylation level and responses with methylRAD/process_methylRAD.R
	
Check overall trends:
	figure_plotting/pca_and_adonis.R
	
Combine datasets for plotting:

	combine the level estimates with comparisons/compare_level.R
		also plots equivalents to main GBM histogram and scatterplot figures for exons, promoters, and 1Kb windows
		
	combine response estimates with comparisons/compare_responses.R
		also outputs GO_MWU input files for fisher's test for missing genes into subdirectory go_mwu/

Plot level figures

	plot level stuff with figure_plotting/plot_gbm_level_figs.R
		plots main GBM histogram and scatterplot figure
		plots cpgoe correlations
		plots alternative measure multipanel plots for all three assays
	
	plot levels for more genomic regions with figure_plotting/region_type_comparison.R
		plots violin plots for additional genomic regions like UTRs and repetitive elements
		plots the scatterplots for correlation between level estimates for repetitive elements
	

	plot response stuff with figure_plotting/plot_gbm_response_figs.R
		plots the main response figure with volcanos and scatterplots
		also plots similar figures for exons, promoters, and 1kb windows
	

	GO_MWU for genes' presence in the response data
	


Window precision stuff
	Set up window precision inputs for each assay:
		picomethyl/process_windowPrecision_picoMethyl.R
		mbdSeq/process_windowPrecision_MBDseq.R
		methylRAD/process_windowPrecision_methylRAD.R

	Plot window precision results with figure_plotting/window_precision.R

Plot read reduction stuff
	First process the read reductions for each:
	#WGBS with picomethyl/picoMethyl_read_reductions.R (first create the simulated reductions following TACC walkthrough)
	#MBD-seq with mbdSeq/MBDseq_read_reductions.R
	#methylRAD with methylRAD/methylRAD_read_reductions.R
		Each of thes above creates countReducedLvls.Rdata and countReducedDifferences.Rdata files
	
	Plot the effect on GBM level estimates with figure_plotting/read_reduced_gbm_level.R
	
	Plot the effect on GBM response with figure_plotting/read_reduced_gbm_responseV3.R
		plots the main read reduction response figure
		plots the PCA false positive figure (decided not to include this though)
